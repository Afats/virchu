        "main text": "University of British Columbia provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation CA.\nUniversity of British Columbia provides funding as a member of The Conversation CA-FR.\nAlready fighting a global pandemic, doctors in Vancouver are now facing an outbreak of dysentery in the Downtown Eastside, the poorest neighbourhood in the city.\nThe disease, called shigellosis, is caused by a highly contagious bacterium known as shigella, which causes symptoms of dysentery: profuse mucous or even bloody diarrhea, low-grade fevers and abdominal cramps.\nShigellosis usually occurs in developing countries where sanitation is poor, making an outbreak in urban Vancouver, where I work as a resident emergency doctor, highly unusual.\n“I don’t ever remember there being a previous outbreak … in the Downtown Eastside,” says Dr. Daniel Kalla, head of the emergency department at St. Paul’s Hospital in downtown Vancouver.\nThe bacteria are usually spread via contaminated hands or sexual contact, and patients can become infected from exposure to only 10 organisms, compared with 1,000 to 100,000 required to transmit salmonella.\n“If someone has shigella and doesn’t clean their hands well enough, even a small amount could lead to transmission,” says Dr. Victor Leung, medical director for Infection Prevention and Control at St. Paul’s Hospital.\n“And even cases that resolve may still be transmitting,” he says, especially when there are shared washrooms.\nOver the next few days, as new cases were confirmed, there seemed to be an emerging pattern of patients being homeless or living in single-room occupancies (SROs), a form of low-income housing.\nAnd … one of the patients was recently diagnosed with COVID and was at a COVID isolation hotel,” says Leung, adding that the timeline of the patient’s symptom onset suggests the infection could have been acquired there.\nApproximately 20 cases of shigellosis have been reported to the BC Centre for Disease Control, according to Dr. Linda Hoang, a medical microbiologist for the organization with a focus on public health.",

Kevin Stitt amended his executive order to remove the 11 p.m. curfew for bars and restaurants to stop in-person service.\nOn Jan. 12, Stitt and state officials announced new quarantine policies for in-person learning.\nThe governor announced teachers or students who are exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 will not have to quarantine as long as that exposure happened in a classroom setting and all protocols were being followed.\nOn Dec. 10, Stitt said he planned to issue an executive order to implement more state restrictions including limiting attendance of public gatherings, excluding churches, and limiting attendance of indoor youth sporting events to 50% capacity.\nThe state health department corrected Nov. 7's daily total on Nov. 8, and opted to not release a new daily COVID-19 totals from Saturday to Sunday.\nHealth officials said it removed the duplicate cases from the total but it only dropped the total cases down from 4,741 to 4,507, a 234 drop.\nStitt released a statement on Nov. 7 and asked Oklahomans \"to do the right thing\" and to follow CDC guidelines -- practice social distancing, wear a face mask and wash your hands regularly -- to help slow the spread.",
